# Widow

Widow is a small jQuery plugin to help automatically remove the 1-word widow that often occurs on the web, particularly in fluid layouts.

## Requirements

jQuery - that's it!

## Collaborators

I'll be growing this plugin over time, but would glady accept pull requests for other typographic features.
